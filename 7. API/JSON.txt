JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays


A JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.


JSON Data - A Name and a Value ("key":value)pair
JSON Object - {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}
JSON Array - "employees":[ {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}]


Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object: parse
A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.

Then, use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object:
var obj = JSON.parse(text);

- JSON:
- JSON is just a file format for text just like PNG is file format for image. (i.e .txt, jpg, .png, .json)
- JSON is just a file format for text with structured text data.

- Before JSON you need to know that in web-application or desktop-application, we have generally 3 file format: CSV, JSON, XML.
- All file format have their own representational structure & syntax which make us easly to read and write data in our application.
- Like if our mobile application need to communicate with server, we can use JSON_file or CSV_file or XML_file.
- Simply JSON is a normal file where our data is defined in well structured manner, so that when sending and receving data its easy for reading.
- And as our data is easily readable we can easily extract, mnipulate, work on data.
- Dhus JSON is used for data sharing(sending and receiving).
- Good usability and readability.

const JSON_DATA = `
                    "id": 1;
                    "name": "Amir";
                    "age": "22";
                   `

- JSON data is simply mutiline string with JS object like structure.
- JSON data is simply mutiline string with JS object like structure, thus can be converted/parse into JS object.

- Change Obbject into String and vise-versa.
