- API vs REST-API vs Real-time-API
- API allows software to communicate with each other.
# API is like a service that allow us to request a data.
> url to json data is called as api. (url->method->data)
> method created to perform some sort of task is called api.



- usually when we create API to exchange data, its in json formate. i.e: 1.employeeAPI.json
- here, "employeeAPI.json" json_file works as an API which is not hosted yet but does all the work of API like storing all empolyee data.
- here, "employeeAPI.json" is simply an API.



- Assume that you have a company and you have store all the detial_data of your employee in this "1.employeeAPI.json" API.
- So simply you will call this "1.employeeAPI.json" API when you need data.
- To get this data, first this data must be hosted somewhere, and you can access this data hitting the url of this Hosted_API_JSON_data.
- Generally url/route help us access to particular remote API(API_data).
    > url ==> server_route ==> controller/method ==> API_JSON_data.



# In js file "2.script to get local API JSON data which is not hosted with routing view" && "3.script to get local API JSON data which is not hosted.js":
    - they are fetching "1.employeeAPI.json" which is not hosted neither in remote nor in local so we are using fs module to fetch this local "1.employeeAPI.json" file.
    - As its not hosted we cannot call it an API.

    - But if "1.employeeAPI.json" file was hosted locally or remotely it would have called API.
    - we would have used either of xhr, fetch, axois, to fetch these hosted_api_json_data, that would have return promise.
    - Promise, beacuase when getting API data it might take some time so we need handle asynchronous operation.
    # when we view it from server side, but when we view it from client side "http://localhost:8006/" is an API.



### Simply API is the service that we create to access our data easily. ###
    - here, 1.API.js is simple api.



# here, when we run "2.script to get local API JSON data which is not hosted with routing view" file.
    - It provie us url/route/path to "1.employeeAPI.json" API file which is not hosted tho.
    - http://localhost:8006/eployeeAPI
    - So, simply http://localhost:8006/eployeeAPI this is API url.
    - Therefore, run "2.script to get local API JSON data which is not hosted with routing view" file.
    - then use http://localhost:8006/eployeeAPI this is API url in Postman to testing purpose.

    # try http://localhost:8006/eployeeAPI when you run "4.script to get local API JSON data which is not hosted.js".

# API ==> Application Programming Interface:
    - API allows software to communicate each other.
    - API is a service which allows us to request a data.
    - get total covid-case data on July using Covid19_API_Service.
    - api is in .json extension
    - api share data in json formate.
    - json(store, cahe data) formate.
    - test if API works? ==> POSTMAN



- API is used to transfer data from one end to another end in any system.
- API determines how different software-component/program/application interract with each other.
- API is set of programming code.
- An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another.
- The purpose of API is to simplyfy the communication between two different programs.

- E.g:
    - JAVA programm -> JDBC API -> database
    - one program -> API -> aonther program
    - Merchant Software in Ecommerce app -> API -> Bank software
        - Bank software provides their API to merchant.
        - Merchant calls the bank API.
        - Dhus, Merchant-software and Bank-software communicates.
    - Youtube provides us an API so that we can fetch different kinds of data from youtube.

- API based application. APIfication of products.
- API helps to transfer data from one apllication to another application in certain formates like JSON, XML, etc.

# API ~ Endpoint ~ URL ~ Route
### You can say that URL/path is an Interface to particular resources/data placed on some other location. (API) ###
