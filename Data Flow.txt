# Data is transmitted in the form of bit between sender to receiver.

# Data transmission mode:
	1. Simplex ==> Keyboard type to monitor. ==> Data flow is Uni-Directional
	2. Half Duplex ==> Waki-talki ==> Data flow is Multi-Directional but not at the same time. ==> asynchronous
	3. Full Duplex ==> Telephone ==> Data flow is Multi-Directional and also at the same time. ==> synchronous

# Data communication/transmission mode vs Computer network(Network).

# Computer network(Network).
	- Set/Arrange/Connects numbers of computers/nodes/devices in such order that data transmission  between those computers/nodes/devices can be done effectively.

# Communication links| Communication media
	- Guided: Twisted Pair, Coaxial, Fibre Optics
	- Unguided media: Microwave, Radio Wave, Cellular, Infrared, Satellite.

# Component of data communication:
	- Sender, Receiver, Messsage, Transmission media, Protocol.

# Features of network:
	- Relaibility, Security, Performance.

# Category of Network:
	- LAN, WAN, MAN

# Protocol:
	- Standard for data transmission.
	- Set of rules that governs data communication.
	- Standard for data transmission that needs to be followed by both sender and receiver.

# Elements of a protocol:
	- Syntax
	- Semantics
	- Timing

# Concept of Standard:
	- De facto Standard,
	- De jure Standard

# Standard Organization in Networking Fields.

# Data is transmitted in the form of bit(0/1) between sender to receiver.

# Two ways/methods for data transmission:
	- Serial transmission,
	- Parallel transmission.

# computer/ devices/ nodes/ stations : sender and reciver.
	- Sender------communiation_links----------Receiver

# Communication media/channel/path/ Data Bus: 
	- Guided or Bounded: Twisted Pair, Coaxial, Fibre Optics
	- Unguided media: Microwave, Radio Wave, Cellular, Infrared, Satellite.

# Communication link:
	-Broadcast.
	-Multipoint.
	-Point-to-multipoint.
	-Private and public.
	-Uplink.
	-Downlink.
	-Forward link.

# Data is transmitted in the form of bit(0/1) between sender to receiver.

# Two ways/methods for data transmission:
	- Serial transmission:(full duplex mode), long distance
	- Parallel transmission: (half duplex mode), short distance

# Classification of serial data transmission:
	- Asynchronous Serial Transmission,
	- Synchronous Serial Transmission,

# Synchronous:
	- existing or occurring at the same time.
	- happens at the same time.

# Asynchronous:
	- doesn't happens at the same time.
